**********************************************

Edited an old Scrimba project. The image on the left shows the original version. The image on the right features my redesigned version, built using the original code as a foundation and expanded with a significant amount of my own HTML and CSS. I also added a new image and a custom logo created in Canva.

* This edit helped me get more comfortable with HTML and CSS structure. Iâ€™m still learning, but each project makes it easier to understand and build.
